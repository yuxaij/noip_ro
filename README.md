# NOI.P.Ro

This is a collection of OI/ACM problems, whose difficulty varies from NOIP to NOI, and currently only Chinese statements/solution are done. 

The very purpose of this project is to build problems that good for someone to give a OI/ACM lecture that structured around.
Subtasks are therefore paid more attention to, instead of the standard algorithm only. 

Usually you are required to have the ability to take the gold medal in NOI to quickly comprehensive what a problem(and its solution) is aimed to, the problem could be sort of suitable for NOIP practice on the level of algorithm, though. 

All problems are built from the very beginning with the tool [tuack](https://gitee.com/mulab/oi_tools). While the source of some problems are really forgotten or unaccessable from public net, I supposed to be the author of most of them.
